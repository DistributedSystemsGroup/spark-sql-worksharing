This paper presents a novel idea of applying cache primitives and multi-query optimization means to large-scale distributed systems. Our prototype extends the current Spark SQL's query optimizer and address multiple challenges to achieve high performance work sharing. Scheduling input queries, cache eviction and adaptive cost model could be other dimensions that we could work to improve our system.
